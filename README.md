## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your outfitweather app up and running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/outfitweather.git
cd outfitweather
\`\`\`

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Node.js packages:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
\`\`\`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables (API Key)

This project uses the WeatherAPI.com API. You'll need an API key to fetch weather data.

1.  **Get your API Key:** Sign up at [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to obtain your free API key.
2.  **Create `.env.local`:** In the root of your project directory, create a file named `.env.local`.
3.  **Add your API Key:** Add the following line to your `.env.local` file, replacing `YOUR_WEATHERAPI_KEY_HERE` with your actual key:

    \`\`\`
    WEATHERAPI_API_KEY=YOUR_WEATHERAPI_KEY_HERE
    \`\`\`

    **Important:** The `.env.local` file is intentionally excluded from Git by default (via `.gitignore`) to prevent your API key from being committed to your public repository.

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
\`\`\`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## üöÄ Deployment to Vercel

This application is designed for seamless deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), the creators of Next.js. Vercel automatically handles serverless functions (like your `/api/weather` route) and environment variables securely.

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Ensure your project is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Import Project to Vercel:**
    *   Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and log in with your GitHub account.
    *   Click "Add New..." -> "Project" and select your `outfitweather` repository from GitHub.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables on Vercel:**
    *   During the import process, or later in your project's "Settings" -> "Environment Variables" on Vercel, add your `WEATHERAPI_API_KEY`.
    *   Set the `Name` to `WEATHERAPI_API_KEY` and paste your actual API key into the `Value` field.
    *   Ensure it's added for all environments (Development, Preview, Production).
4.  **Deploy:** Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application. Any subsequent pushes to your connected Git branch will trigger new deployments.

Next, let's update the application code to reflect the new name:

```typescriptreact file="app/layout.tsx"
[v0-no-op-code-block-prefix]import type React from "react"
import type { Metadata } from "next"
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
import "./globals.css"
import Navbar from "@/components/navbar"
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/theme-provider"
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster"

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] })

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "outfitweather",
  description: "Decide what to wear based on the current weather in your location with outfitweather.",
    generator: 'v0.dev'
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="system" enableSystem>
          <div className="flex flex-col min-h-screen">
            <Navbar />
            <main className="flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4 md:p-6">{children}</main>
          </div>
          <Toaster />
        </ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
